# Claude Code Instructions

## Backlog Documentation

When changes are made to the codebase or new features are implemented, ask the user if they want to update the backlog documentation files:

- `backlog/product_roadmap.md` - Feature status and future plans
- `backlog/implementation_plan.md` - What has been built
- `backlog/tech-stack-summary.md` - Technologies used

This keeps the documentation in sync with the actual state of the project.
